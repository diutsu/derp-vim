# Vim

vim configuration and compilation of plugins and stuff.

Working out of the box.  For best results, I recomend vim 7.3.x or higher

## Download:
```
$ cd ~
$ git clone git://github.com/diutsu/derp-vim/
```
<br>
check the crazy and messy stuff going on:<br>
```
.vimrc
```


## Plugins included:
#### All via pathogen  
- aSwitch
- css_colors
- delimitMate
- sparkup (in folder ftplugin)
- NERDcommenter
- NERDtree
- php-doc
- scmdiff
- SearchComplete
- supertab
- vim-colors-solarized
- vim-powerline

## Colorschemes included:

- cloudsmidnight
- desert256
- molokai
- moria
- mustang
- zenburn

## NOTE
I take no credit for any of the plugins, and I also might not be using the lastest version, nor did I check every plugin licensing terms, I got them for free of charge via either github or vim.org so I assume that the idea is to share.
