Vim
===
vim configuration and compilation of plugins and stuff.

Working out of the box.  For best results, I recomend vim 7.3.x or higher

Some crazy stuff is going on the:
.vimrc 

Plugins included:
===
- pathogen
amd also the following plugins:
- aSwitch
- css_colors
- delimitMate
- sparkup (in folder ftplugin)
- NERDcommenter
- NERDtree
- php-doc
- scmdiff
- SearchComplete
- supertab
- vim-colors-solarized
- vim-powerline

Colorschemes included:
===
- cloudsmidnight
- desert256
- molokai
- moria
- mustang
- zenburn

NOTE
===
I take no credit for any of the plugins, and I also might not be using the lastest version, nor did I check every plugin licensing terms, I got them for free of charge via either github or vim.org so I assume that the idea is to share.
